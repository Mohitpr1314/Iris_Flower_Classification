# Iris_Flower_Classification

This project uses a Jupyter Notebook to classify different species of Iris flowers based on the length of their petals and sepals.

## How to Get Started

1. Clone or download this repository to your computer.

2. Open the provided Jupyter Notebook.

3. Run the cells in the notebook to see the code in action.

## Prerequisites

Make sure you have the following Python libraries installed:

- scikit-learn
- pandas
- matplotlib
- pandas

You can install them using `pip`.

## What's in the Notebook

- **Data Loading and Preprocessing**: The notebook loads the Iris dataset and prepares it for analysis.

- **Model Training**: It uses the K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) method to build a classification model.

- **Model Evaluation**: The notebook checks how accurate the model is in predicting Iris species.

- **Visualization**: It shows a simple scatter plot to help you visualize the classification.

## Customization

Feel free to change the features used for classification or try different classification methods. Experiment and have fun with it!
